# ZweiDTest

Followed a tutorial by [pixelnest.io](https://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/). The three sound effects (`explosion.wav`, `shot_enemy.wav` and `shot_player.wav`) are also taken from there. The song (`music.mp3`) is a cover version of a song by Hiroki Kikuta from the *Trials of Mana* soundtrack ("*Nuclear Fusion*").
